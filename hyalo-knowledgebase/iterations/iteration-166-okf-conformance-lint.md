# Iteration 166 — OKF conformance lint profile

Positions hyalo as *the* OKF validator the ecosystem currently lacks. Encodes SPEC §9 as a lint profile, respecting OKF's permissive-consumption model (warn, don't reject). See [[okf-open-knowledge-format]].

## Goal

`hyalo lint --profile okf` reports exactly the SPEC §9 conformance status of a bundle — erroring only on true violations, warning on everything the spec says MUST NOT be rejected.

## Steps / Tasks

### 1. Conformance profile

- [ ] `--profile okf` (or an `okf`-tagged rule bundle) enabling the §9 checks in `crates/hyalo-mdlint`
- [ ] Rule: every non-reserved `.md` has a parseable YAML frontmatter block (error if absent/unparseable)
- [ ] Rule: every such block has a non-empty `type` (error) — reuse iter-163 `exempt` for reserved files
- [ ] Rule: reserved files follow §6/§7 structure when present (`index.md` link-list shape; `log.md` date grouping) — warn
- [ ] Ensure broken cross-links are **warn**, unknown `type`/extra keys are **allowed** (no error), per permissive model

### 2. Citation linting (advisory — OKF convention, warn-level)

hyalo has no citation-aware linting today (only generic MD link rules + internal broken-link repair). Make `# Citations` first-class in the okf profile. Convention (SHOULD), so warn-only + opt-in — never a conformance error.

- [ ] Rule `citations-present`: a concept doc making factual claims (heuristic: non-reserved, `resource`-less or `Reference`-typed, or configurable type set) SHOULD have a `# Citations` section — warn if absent
- [ ] Rule `citations-well-formed`: entries under `# Citations` are a list of links (URL, bundle-absolute/relative path, or `references/…`), not free prose — warn on malformed entries. Accept **both numbered lists (SPEC §8 says "numbered") and `-` bullets (what all official sample bundles actually use)**; style preference configurable, default lenient
- [ ] Rule `citations-resolve`: bundle-relative / `references/` citation links must resolve to existing files (reuse the `hyalo links` resolver) — warn on unresolved (broken links stay warn per spec)
- [ ] External `http(s)` citation URLs: parsed and surfaced, but **not** network-checked by default (determinism/offline); optional `--check-urls` left as a future flag, out of scope here
- [ ] All citation rules live behind the okf profile and are individually toggleable via `hyalo lint-rules set`

### 3. Optional augmentation guards (parity with reference_agent)

- [ ] Warn when an edit would drop an existing `#` heading or shrink a `# Schema` field set / `# Citations` count (best-effort, diff-aware via `--files-from`)
- [ ] Keep these advisory (warn), off by default outside the okf profile

### 4. Tests

- [ ] e2e: all three committed sample bundles report conformant (0 errors) under `--profile okf`
- [ ] e2e: a doc missing `type` → error; a broken link → warn (not error); an unknown `type` → clean
- [ ] `cargo fmt` / clippy `-D warnings` / `cargo test --workspace -q` green

### 5. Docs sync (same PR)

- [ ] `hyalo lint --help` documents `--profile okf`; `hyalo lint-rules list` shows the okf rules
- [ ] README.md: "Validate an OKF bundle" section (`hyalo lint --profile okf`), note the warn-not-reject stance
- [ ] Update the `okf` skill to include validation in the loop
- [ ] Update [[okf-open-knowledge-format]] gap #5 status → done; mark research follow-through complete

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `hyalo lint --profile okf` matches SPEC §9: errors only on missing frontmatter / missing `type`; warns on reserved-file structure and broken links; never errors on unknown types/keys
- [ ] All three official sample bundles pass clean
- [ ] Quality gates pass; docs + skill updated in the same PR
