# Iteration 166 — OKF conformance lint profile

Positions hyalo as *the* OKF validator the ecosystem currently lacks. Encodes SPEC §9 as a lint profile, respecting OKF's permissive-consumption model (warn, don't reject). See [[okf-open-knowledge-format]].

**iter-165 retrospective (2026-07-17):** `okf index`/`okf log` shipped in `crates/hyalo-cli/src/commands/okf.rs` (PR #193); a post-merge review pass found and fixed three correctness bugs there worth carrying forward:
1. **Directory-tree walks must include ancestor-only directories.** The `by_dir` map was originally keyed only by directories that directly contain a concept file — a directory holding *just* subdirectories (no files of its own) was silently skipped, producing a broken `a/index.md` link from its parent. Any new tree-walking logic in step 1's frontmatter/reserved-file checks (or the `#` heading walk in step 3) must independently enumerate every directory, not just ones with direct file children — reuse `okf.rs`'s now-fixed `by_dir`/`child_dirs` pattern rather than re-deriving it.
2. **CRLF line endings are a recurring blind spot in new `okf` code.** `find_heading`/`prepend_log_entry` in `okf.rs` originally only stripped `\n`, so a CRLF-terminated `log.md` would never match an existing date heading. The rest of the codebase already normalizes/tolerates CRLF explicitly (see `lint.rs`'s frontmatter-terminator handling) — step 1's "reserved files follow §6/§7 structure" rule and step 4's e2e tests should include a CRLF-terminated fixture for `index.md`/`log.md` structure checks, not just LF fixtures.
3. **Marker/heading string search must anchor on structural position, not first occurrence.** `splice_managed_region` originally used the first `INDEX_END` match, which could sit *before* `INDEX_BEGIN` if the marker text was merely mentioned in prose above the real region. If step 1's reserved-file structure check parses the `<!-- okf:index:begin/end -->` managed region to validate its shape, reuse `okf.rs`'s marker-finding helper (searches for END starting after BEGIN) rather than a naive `str::find`.

No scope changes to the steps below; these are implementation cautions for whoever writes the tree-walk and reserved-file-shape rules in step 1.

## Goal

`hyalo lint --profile okf` reports exactly the SPEC §9 conformance status of a bundle — erroring only on true violations, warning on everything the spec says MUST NOT be rejected.

## Steps / Tasks

### 1. Conformance profile

- [x] `--profile okf` enabling the §9 checks in `crates/hyalo-mdlint` as an **ephemeral overlay** (no config needed — CI / third-party bundles). In a vault initialized via `init --profile okf`, the same rules come from `.hyalo.toml` so **plain `hyalo lint` suffices** — decision: no `okf lint` subcommand (see [[okf-open-knowledge-format]] CLI-design §3a)
- [x] Overlay and `init` materialization MUST share the same fragment-merge code; overlay is **idempotent** — `lint --profile okf` on an already-initialized okf vault behaves identically to plain `hyalo lint` (test this; model in [[path-bound-schemas]] "How schemas, bind, and profiles fit together")
- [x] `hyalo okf --help` and `okf index`/`okf log` outputs emit a hint: `-> hyalo lint --profile okf  # validate bundle conformance`
- [x] `--profile` composes with the existing lint surface (`--fix`, `--rule`, `--strict`, `--files-from -`) — no forked code path
- [x] Rule: every non-reserved `.md` has a parseable YAML frontmatter block (error if absent/unparseable)
- [x] Rule: every such block has a non-empty `type` (error) — reuse iter-163 `exempt` for reserved files
- [x] Rule: reserved files follow §6/§7 structure when present (`index.md` link-list shape; `log.md` date grouping) — warn
- [x] Ensure broken cross-links are **warn**, unknown `type`/extra keys are **allowed** (no error), per permissive model

### 2. Citation linting (advisory — OKF convention, warn-level)

hyalo has no citation-aware linting today (only generic MD link rules + internal broken-link repair). Make `# Citations` first-class in the okf profile. Convention (SHOULD), so warn-only + opt-in — never a conformance error.

- [x] Rule `citations-present`: a concept doc making factual claims (heuristic: non-reserved, `resource`-less or `Reference`-typed, or configurable type set) SHOULD have a `# Citations` section — warn if absent
- [x] Rule `citations-well-formed`: entries under `# Citations` are a list of links (URL, bundle-absolute/relative path, or `references/…`), not free prose — warn on malformed entries. Accept **both numbered lists (SPEC §8 says "numbered") and `-` bullets (what all official sample bundles actually use)**; style preference configurable, default lenient
- [x] Rule `citations-resolve`: bundle-relative / `references/` citation links must resolve to existing files (reuse the `hyalo links` resolver) — warn on unresolved (broken links stay warn per spec)
- [x] External `http(s)` citation URLs: parsed and surfaced, but **not** network-checked by default (determinism/offline); optional `--check-urls` left as a future flag, out of scope here
- [x] All citation rules live behind the okf profile and are individually toggleable via `hyalo lint-rules set`

### 3. Optional augmentation guards (parity with reference_agent)

- [x] Warn when an edit would drop an existing `#` heading or shrink a `# Schema` field set / `# Citations` count (best-effort, diff-aware via `--files-from`)
- [x] Keep these advisory (warn), off by default outside the okf profile

### 4. Tests

- [x] e2e: all three committed sample bundles report conformant (0 errors) under `--profile okf`
- [x] e2e: a doc missing `type` → error; a broken link → warn (not error); an unknown `type` → clean
- [x] `cargo fmt` / clippy `-D warnings` / `cargo test --workspace -q` green

### 5. Docs sync (same PR)

- [x] `hyalo lint --help` documents `--profile okf`; `hyalo lint-rules list` shows the okf rules
- [x] README.md: "Validate an OKF bundle" section (`hyalo lint --profile okf`), note the warn-not-reject stance
- [x] Update the `okf` skill to include validation in the loop
- [x] Update [[okf-open-knowledge-format]] gap #5 status → done; mark research follow-through complete

### 6. Retrospective (learnings-propagation — do this LAST, always)

- [x] Review the remaining profile iterations ([[iteration-167-madr-profile]] through [[iteration-169-changelog-profile]]) against implementation learnings — the reserved-file structure checks built here are the seed of iter-169's heading-grammar mode — update their scope/design/tasks before starting the next iteration

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `hyalo lint --profile okf` matches SPEC §9: errors only on missing frontmatter / missing `type`; warns on reserved-file structure and broken links; never errors on unknown types/keys
- [x] A conformant bundle built to the shape of the three official sample bundles (`crypto_bitcoin`, `ga4`, `stackoverflow` — external, not vendored; network access is out of scope per the offline/determinism principle) passes clean under `--profile okf`; covered by `conformant_bundle_has_zero_errors` in `okf_profile.rs`
- [x] Quality gates pass (`cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace -q` all verified green on this branch during review); docs + skill updated in the same PR
