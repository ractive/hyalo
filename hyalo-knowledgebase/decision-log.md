# Decision Log

## DEC-001: CLI Flag Style (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** Use idiomatic `--flag` style with clap subcommands, not Obsidian's `key=value` style.

**Why:** AI agents generate CLI calls — standard flag syntax is universally supported across all agent frameworks and shell environments.

## DEC-002: `--dir` Instead of Vault Concept (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** Accept `--dir <path>` global option (defaults to `.`) to specify the working directory. No vault registry, no vault names.

**Why:** Self-contained tool. No application state, no config files to manage. Just point at a directory.

## DEC-003: ~~`--path` for File Targeting~~ (2026-03-20) — SUPERSEDED by DEC-018

**Decision:** ~~Single `--path` flag for all file targeting.~~ Replaced by `--file` (single file) and `--glob` (pattern). See [[decision-log#DEC-018]].

The following still applies: always relative to `--dir`, always requires `.md` extension, no fuzzy wikilink-style name resolution. Leading `./` is tolerated and normalized. Missing `.md` triggers a helpful error with a hint.

## DEC-004: Output Formats — JSON Default, Text for Humans (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** Global `--format` option on all commands. Two formats: `json` (default) and `text`. No YAML output format.

**Why:** JSON is what AI agents parse. Text is for human debugging. YAML adds complexity with little value — frontmatter is already readable via `text`. Can be added later if needed.

## DEC-005: Structured Error Output (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** Errors go to stderr, with non-zero exit code. Error format matches `--format`:
- JSON (default): `{"error": "...", "path": "...", "hint": "...", "cause": "..."}`
- Text: plain human-readable message

Fields (`path`, `hint`, `cause`) are omitted when not applicable. The `cause` field carries the underlying OS/library error (e.g. "permission denied", "disk full").

**Why:** AI agents need parseable errors to react programmatically. The `hint` field enables self-correction (e.g. suggesting `.md` extension). The `cause` field surfaces the actual system error without the agent needing to guess.

## DEC-006: Frontmatter Rewrite on Mutation (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** Use serde_yaml_ng for both reading and writing frontmatter. Full rewrite of the YAML block on `set`/`remove` — no formatting preservation.

**Why:** serde_yaml_ng cannot preserve formatting (comments, quoting style, blank lines). Obsidian itself rewrites frontmatter on save. The files are machine-managed. Keeps the implementation simple. Can revisit if hand-edited YAML preservation becomes important.

## DEC-007: serde_yaml_ng over serde_yaml (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** Use `serde_yaml_ng` 0.10 instead of the deprecated `serde_yaml` 0.9.

**Why:** dtolnay archived `serde_yaml` — no further fixes. `serde_yaml_ng` is the community-endorsed fork with active maintenance and a drop-in API. Avoid `serde_yml` (RUSTSEC-2025-0068: unsound, causes segfaults). `serde_norway` was considered but has less community endorsement.

## DEC-008: Sandbox --dir with Path Traversal Rejection (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** `resolve_file` rejects absolute paths, backslash-prefixed paths, and any path containing `..` segments. Operations are sandboxed to `--dir`.

**Why:** Without this, `property set --path ../../../etc/important.md` could write outside the intended directory. Since `property set`/`remove` are mutation commands, this is a security boundary.

## DEC-009: Unclosed Frontmatter is an Error (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** `Document::parse` returns an error when a file starts with `---` but has no closing `---` delimiter. The streaming `read_frontmatter` reader also enforces a 100-line / 8KB budget.

**Why:** Silently treating unclosed frontmatter as "no frontmatter" would cause `property set` to write a new `---` block on top, leaving the original opening `---` in the body — corrupting the file. Failing early is safer than silent corruption.

## DEC-010: Forward-Slash Path Normalization (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** All relative paths in output and glob matching use forward slashes (`/`), even on Windows.

**Why:** `std::path::Path::to_string_lossy()` uses `\` on Windows, which breaks glob patterns and produces inconsistent JSON output across platforms. Forward slashes work on all OSes.

## DEC-011: Custom Streaming Scanner over pulldown-cmark (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** Implement a custom line-by-line streaming scanner instead of using `pulldown-cmark` or another markdown parser.

**Why:** Streams line by line with only one line buffered at a time. Supports early abort via callback pattern (`ScanAction::Stop`). No full-body buffering. Reusable for links, tags, and tasks across iterations 2-4. We fully control Obsidian-specific syntax handling (`[[wikilinks]]`, `![[embeds]]`, `%%comments%%`). No external dependency.

## DEC-012: Callback-Based Scanner with ScanAction (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** The scanner uses a visitor/callback pattern where the caller provides a closure. The closure returns `ScanAction::Continue` or `ScanAction::Stop` to control flow.

**Why:** Keeps the scanner generic — different extraction tasks (links, tags, tasks) provide different visitors. Early abort is useful for queries like "find the first N matches" without scanning entire files.

## DEC-013: Defer backlinks/orphans/deadends to Indexing (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** `backlinks`, `orphans`, and `deadends` commands are deferred to the indexing iteration, not included in iteration 2.

**Why:** These commands require scanning all files in the vault per invocation. Without an index, they would be O(n²) — each call walks every file. The indexing iteration will provide SQLite-backed lookups that make these queries efficient.

## DEC-014: Simple Direct Link Resolution (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** `[[foo]]` resolves via direct filesystem probes: check `foo` then `foo.md` relative to the vault root. No shortest-path search, no case-insensitive matching. Path-qualified links (`[[sub/foo]]`) use exact match.

**Why:** Keeps resolution simple and predictable for the initial implementation. Full Obsidian-style shortest-path and case-insensitive resolution is deferred to the indexing iteration.

## DEC-015: %%comments%% Deferred as Known Limitation (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** Obsidian `%%comment%%` blocks are not yet handled by the scanner. Links inside comments will be incorrectly extracted.

**Why:** Adding comment tracking is straightforward (similar to fenced code block tracking) but wasn't needed for the initial link implementation. Documented as a known limitation. Can be added to the scanner in a future iteration since we control all the code.

## DEC-016: Single-File Only for `links` and `unresolved` Commands (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** Both `links` and `unresolved` require exactly one file via `--file`. No vault-wide mode, no glob support.

**Why:** AI agents work on one file at a time. Vault-wide link dumps are expensive (full directory walk + every file read) and produce bulk data that's hard to act on. If the agent needs links from multiple files, it calls the command per file. Bulk graph operations (backlinks, orphans) belong in a future indexed command.

## DEC-017: Minimal Link Object — target, path, label (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** The link output object contains only three fields: `target` (raw text as written), `path` (resolved file path or null), `label` (display text or null).

**Why:** Fields like `style`, `line`, `is_embed`, `heading`, `block_ref` are parser internals. An AI agent needs to know where a link points and what it's called, not how the syntax was written. Start minimal, add fields later only when a concrete use case emerges.

## DEC-018: `--file` and `--glob` as the Two File-Targeting Flags (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** All commands use exactly one of two flags for file targeting:
- `--file` — exactly one file (e.g. `property read --file note.md`, `links --file note.md`)
- `--glob` — a glob pattern matching multiple files (e.g. `properties --glob "research/*.md"`)

The old `--path` flag is retired. Both flags are always relative to `--dir` and require `.md` extension.

**Why:** `--path` was ambiguous — it could mean a single file, a directory, or a glob pattern depending on context. `--file` signals "exactly one file" and `--glob` signals "pattern matching multiple files". This is self-documenting and consistent with conventions in tools like ripgrep and fd. Supersedes the original DEC-003 `--path` convention.

## DEC-019: Link Targets Must Be Resolved Paths (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** The link object includes `path` — the file path relative to `--dir` that the link resolves to, or `null` for broken links. The raw `target` field preserves the original text as written.

**Why:** AI agents work with file paths, not Obsidian note names. `[[My Note]]` is meaningless to an agent — it needs `notes/my-note.md` to open the file. Both fields are needed: `path` for navigation, `target` for display and search/replace in the source file.

## DEC-020: Frontmatter-Only Tags — No Inline `#tag` Support (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** Tag commands only read and write the `tags` property in YAML frontmatter. Inline `#tags` in the markdown body are not extracted, searched, or modified.

**Why:** Frontmatter tags are structured data — a YAML list that can be reliably parsed, added to, and removed from. Inline `#tags` are embedded in prose, making extraction ambiguous (code blocks, URLs, headings with `#`) and modification risky (could corrupt surrounding text). Frontmatter tags are also what Obsidian uses for programmatic tag management. If inline tag extraction is needed later, it can be added as a separate read-only feature.

## DEC-021: Tasks Are File-Scoped Only (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** All task commands (`tasks`, `task read`, `task toggle`, `task set-status`) require `--file`. No vault-wide task listing or searching.

**Why:** Tasks live in the markdown body, so vault-wide task search requires reading the full content of every file — not just frontmatter. Without an index, this is O(n) full-file reads per invocation. For an AI agent, "what tasks are in this file?" is the actionable question. Vault-wide task queries ("all incomplete tasks across the project") belong in the indexing iteration.

## DEC-022: Tags Support Vault-Wide Operations Without Index (2026-03-20)

**Decision:** Tag commands (`tags`, `tag find`, `tag add`, `tag remove`) support vault-wide and glob-scoped operations without requiring an index. They scan all matching files on each invocation.

**Why:** Tags live in frontmatter, which is at most ~8KB per file and can be read without buffering the body. The existing `read_frontmatter` streaming reader stops at the closing `---`. For a 1000-file vault, this means reading ~8MB of data at most — well within acceptable latency. Pre-filtering optimizations (byte-level `tags:` search before YAML parse) can be explored if benchmarks show need. This is fundamentally different from vault-wide task search (DEC-021), which requires reading entire file contents.

## DEC-023: Split `properties`/`tags` into `summary` + `list` Subcommands (2026-03-21)

**Context:** The `properties` and `tags` commands each produced a single aggregate output (unique names with counts). There was no way to get per-file detail — which file has which properties or tags. Adding `--file`/`--glob` to the top-level commands overloaded a single output shape, making it unclear whether the output was aggregate or per-file.

**Decision:** Split both commands into two subcommands:
- `summary` (default) — aggregate unique names with types/counts, same as the original output
- `list` — per-file detail, each file with its property key/value pairs or tags array

The `summary` subcommand is the default, so `hyalo properties` and `hyalo tags` without a subcommand still produce the same aggregate output as before. The `--file`/`--glob` flags move to the subcommand level.

**Consequences:**
- No breaking change for callers that used `hyalo properties` or `hyalo tags` without flags — they get `summary` by default
- Callers that used `--file`/`--glob` at the top level must now place them after the subcommand name (e.g. `hyalo properties list --glob '*.md'`)
- Consistent CLI model: both `properties` and `tags` follow the same `summary`/`list` pattern
- Shared helpers extracted to avoid duplicating file-discovery logic between the two command groups

## DEC-024: Outline Command — Section-Aware Structural Extraction (2026-03-21)

**Context:** An LLM needs to understand a document's structure without reading it in full. Existing commands answer narrow questions (`properties` → metadata, `tags` → categorization, `links` → flat reference list), but none give the structural skeleton: what sections exist, what each section references, and whether work is complete.

**Decision:** Add an `outline` command that extracts per-section structure:
- **Headings** with level, text, and line number — the document skeleton
- **Frontmatter keys with types** — what metadata exists (not values)
- **Wikilinks per section** — which section references what (not just "file has links")
- **Task counts per section** — `total`/`done` per section (null if no tasks)
- **Code block languages per section** — content type hints

Content before the first heading gets a synthetic `level: 0` section (only if non-empty). ATX headings only — no setext.

Supports `--file`, `--glob`, and vault-wide mode (unlike `links` which is single-file per DEC-016) because outline output is lightweight.

**Why:** This gives an LLM a "table of contents with context" — enough to navigate, decide where to edit, and assess completeness without reading the full body. Each piece of enrichment (links, tasks, code blocks) answers a question an LLM would otherwise need a separate command call or full file read for.

**Consequences:**
- Scanner gains heading extraction capability (ATX headings outside code blocks)
- New section-aware accumulator pattern for attributing links/tasks/code blocks to their enclosing section
- Multi-file outline produces an array — consistent with `properties list` and `tags list` output shape

## DEC-025: Typed Structs for JSON Output (2026-03-21)

**Context:** All commands built JSON output dynamically using `serde_json::json!()` macros and manual `serde_json::Map` construction. Shapes were implicit — defined only by the code that constructed them and the tests that parsed them. The outline command needed to reuse the same property and tag shapes as existing commands.

**Decision:** Introduce `src/types.rs` with `#[derive(Serialize)]` structs for all JSON output shapes. Refactor all existing commands to construct typed structs instead of ad-hoc `json!()` values. Add `format_output<T: Serialize>()` to `output.rs` as the standard serialization path.

**Types introduced:** `PropertyInfo`, `FileProperties`, `PropertySummaryEntry`, `PropertyRemoved`, `PropertyFindResult`, `PropertyMutationResult`, `FileTags`, `TagSummary`, `TagSummaryEntry`, `TagFindResult`, `TagMutationResult`, `LinkInfo`, `FileLinks`, `FileOutline`, `OutlineSection`, `TaskCount`.

**Why:** Typed structs guarantee that the outline command's `properties` and `tags` fields are structurally identical to what `properties list` and `tags list` produce — the compiler enforces it. Also removes the `build_find_json` / `build_list_mutation_json` generic helpers that used dynamic key names, replacing them with specific structs per command.

**Consequences:**
- JSON output is now compiler-verified — shape mismatches are caught at build time
- New commands can reuse existing types instead of guessing the right `json!()` shape
- Removed ~50 lines of generic JSON-building helpers from `commands/mod.rs`
